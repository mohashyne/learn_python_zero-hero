"""Web automation with Selenium and Python for brute-forcing login combinations."""

# To automate the process of trying multiple username and password combinations, you can create a loop that iterates over the possible combinations. The script will try each combination, and if the login is successful, it will stop the loop and continue with the next steps.

# How It Works

#     Setup:
#         Create lists of possible usernames and passwords.
#         Set up the browser using Selenium.

#     Login Loop:
#         For each combination of username and password, try logging in.
#         Use Selenium to interact with the username and password fields, clear them, input the values, and submit the form.

#     Check Success:
#         After submitting the form, check if the login was successful by looking for a specific element on the page (e.g., "Sign out" in the page source).

#     Stop on Success:
#         If the login is successful, exit the loop and continue to the next step.

#     Error Handling:
#         If an error occurs (e.g., element not found), it logs the issue and moves to the next combination.

# Important Notes

#     Ethical Use:
#         This code is only for automating login attempts for accounts you own or have explicit permission to access. Unauthorized use is unethical and likely illegal.

#     Login Detection:
#         Update the success condition (e.g., "Sign out" in the page source) based on the actual behavior of the website after a successful login.

#     Rate Limiting:
#         Some websites have security measures like CAPTCHA or account lockout for multiple failed login attempts. Use this responsibly.

#     Headless Mode:
#         You can enable headless mode (chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")) if you donâ€™t need to see the browser window.

# This script will automate the process of testing combinations and proceed once the correct credentials are found.
