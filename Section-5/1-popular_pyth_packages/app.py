#     Example: Making an API call to retrieve weather data from an external service.

# 2. Flask - Web Framework

#     Use Case: Create lightweight web applications or RESTful APIs quickly with minimal setup.
#     Example: Building a small blog application or an API for a mobile app.

# 3. Django - Web Framework

#     Use Case: Build full-scale, feature-rich web applications with built-in admin interfaces, ORM, and authentication.
#     Example: Developing an e-commerce platform or a social networking site.

# 4. NumPy - Scientific Computing Library

#     Use Case: Perform efficient numerical operations on large arrays and matrices.
#     Example: Processing image data for computer vision tasks.

# 5. Pandas - Data Analysis and Manipulation Library

#     Use Case: Analyze, clean, and manipulate structured data from various file formats like CSV, Excel, or SQL databases.
#     Example: Cleaning and preparing a dataset for machine learning.

# 6. Matplotlib - Data Visualization Library

#     Use Case: Create static, animated, or interactive visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and histograms.
#     Example: Visualizing stock price trends over time.

# 7. TensorFlow - Machine Learning Library

#     Use Case: Train and deploy large-scale machine learning models, especially for deep learning.
#     Example: Developing a neural network for image recognition.

# 8. Scikit-learn - Machine Learning Library

#     Use Case: Implement classic machine learning algorithms like linear regression, clustering, and support vector machines.
#     Example: Predicting house prices based on historical data.

# 9. Keras - Deep Learning Library

#     Use Case: Build and train deep learning models with a user-friendly API on top of TensorFlow or other backends.
#     Example: Creating a sentiment analysis model for text data.

# 10. PyTorch - Deep Learning Library

#     Use Case: Develop and experiment with deep learning models, especially in research or dynamic computation graphs.
#     Example: Building a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image synthesis.
