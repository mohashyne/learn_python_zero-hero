# Opening a Browser with Python

# In Python, you can open a web browser using the webbrowser module, which provides an interface to display web pages to users. This module is part of Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.
# Why Do We Need It?

# Opening a browser programmatically can be useful in various real-life scenarios, including:

#     Automating Tasks:
#         Automatically opening URLs for users, such as a documentation page, survey form, or support page.

#     Building User-Friendly Scripts:
#         Launching web-based applications, portals, or dashboards directly from a script or application.

#     Testing and Debugging:
#         Quickly launching web pages during development to verify changes.

#     Interactive Applications:
#         Providing a seamless way to redirect users to a website, e.g., for authentication or payment.

# How to Use the webbrowser Module

# Hereâ€™s how you can open a browser using Python:
# 1. Opening a URL


# Open a web page in the default browser
webbrowser.open("https://www.crystalbluetech.com")

# 2. Opening a URL in a New Tab
webbrowser.open_new_tab("https://www.youtube.com")

# # 3. Opening a URL in a New Window
webbrowser.open_new("https://www.sqlbolt.com")

# # Real-Life Scenarios
# # Scenario 1: Open Documentation or Help Page
# # A software application can open its help or documentation page in a browser:


# def open_help():
#     webbrowser.open("https://docs.python.org/3/")
    
# open_help()

# # Scenario 2: Redirect Users to Login Page
# # During an authentication process, an application can redirect users to a web-based login page:
# login_url = "https://accounts.google.com/signin"
# webbrowser.open(login_url)

# # Scenario 3: Automate Daily Web Tasks
# # For repetitive tasks like opening stock price dashboards or news sites every morning:

# # List of websites to open
# urls = [
#     "https://www.nytimes.com",
#     "https://www.cnn.com",
#     "https://finance.yahoo.com"
# ]

# # Open each URL
# for url in urls:
#     webbrowser.open(url)


# # Using Python to open a browser programmatically can significantly improve user experience and save time in various automated workflows.
